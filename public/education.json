    "description": "I started my software developer journey during my first year of college. At the time, I thought coding would not appeal to me, but after taking my first coding class in Python I was hooked! From there I ventured more into object oriented languages with C++ and C, and learned the fundamentals of algorithms, database storage, design theory and more! Along with programming classes, I focused with a minor in business management classes since creating my own product or company interested me so much. After going to school for 12 semesters straight (including summer classes), I graduated as an honors student with an overall GPA of 3.9 and earning the achievement of Summa Cum Laude.",
